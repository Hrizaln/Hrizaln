## About Me

I’m passionate about real-world technology, especially in the fields of networking, automation, and educational content creation. My focus includes network configuration, Arduino-based systems, and practical solutions for everyday tech challenges.

Under the name Ailua, I share hands-on tutorials and projects on TikTok (@anairdnehzi), mainly covering topics such as computer networking and MikroTik RouterOS. My goal is to make technical concepts more accessible through real implementation, and to keep learning by building.
